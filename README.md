# ComfyUI-Openpose-Editor-Plus
It is expected to add the functions of background reference and imported poses on the basis of editing character actions, but it is currently busy and unsure when it will be done.

This fork has been modified slightly, adding canvas height and width as an option to resize the canvas.

This now fixes the issue when using landscape mode on high resolution images, the pose was being cut off. The top and bottom of the pose are no longer being cut off in the image.
